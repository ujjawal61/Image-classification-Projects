# Finger-count-and-detection
Program that can detect a hand, segment the hand, and count the number of fingers being held up
Built a Program that can detect a hand, segment the hand, and count the number of fingers being held up using various methods and features of Open CV library. 
Some of the steps included in this project are Finding the average background Value, applying a threshold, detecting the contours,
